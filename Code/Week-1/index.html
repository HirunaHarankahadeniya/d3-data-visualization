    <p>
      There has been a substantial boom in pet ownership since 2019, with an
      estimated <b>30.4 million pets</b>
      nationally. The proportion of pet-owning households has increased
      significantly from 61% to 69% in
      <i>just over two years</i>—led by a surge in dog ownership. Following
      table is a result of a research conducted by the shows the Animal Medicine
      Australia Org. about the pet ownership in Australia during the COVID
      pandemic. It includes different kinds of pets including,

    <p>
      This estimate of 30.4 million pets is substantially higher than the 28.5
      million estimated two years prior in the 2019 Pets in Australia report—due
      to an overall population growth, an increased proportion of pet-owning
      households, slight increases in the average number of animals (especially
      dogs and cats—the two most prominent types of companion animals in
      Australia), and a rise in households with multiple types of pets (from 22%
      to 27%).
